# Step 1

Code affected: none

Created this file.
#########
# Step 2

Code affected: all .java files

Reformatted using the Google Java style formatter.
#########
# Step 3

Code affected: Path.leave

Flaw: unnecessary if, leading to duplicate code.

Fix: replaced if statement with a single assignment statement.
######### 
# Step 5

Code affected: 1.SwitchPath.java and TreasureHunter.java; 2.All java files.

Flaw: 1.Wrong implementations in SwitchPath, although neighbour3 is defined, but still unable to turn to the third exit because of not being used; Wrong time to change direction in TreasureHunter 2.Not using accurate access control for all classes 

Fix: 1.In SwitchPath, rewrite methods register(), unRegister(), exit(), nextPath() to fix different functionalities that end3 should has, and override the enter(); And rewrite method move() in TreasureHunter in that able to update the direction after check whether it is ok to enter or not. 2.Change all java files from default to public, add serialVersionUID.
######### 
# Step 6

Code affected: ColorUtils.java, Treasure.java

Flaw: Classes that are unnecessary for this program

Fix: Remove redundant .java file
######### 
# Step 7

Code affected: Person.java, Person1.java, Person2.java

Flaw: Redundant Person1.java and Person2.java for this program

Fix: Remove Person1.java, Person2.java and instance variable(totalWeight, forward) that are not used in Person.java, and implement addToPath() in Person.java
######### 
# Step 8

Code affected: All .java file that has a hierarchy relationship with Path

Flaw: 1.Path should be an abstract class, access control problem; 2.There are unneeded constructor in ***Path.java and **Path.java that take in only Map T as input

Fix: 1.Make them abstraction(exitOK(), register(), unRegister(), exit(), nextPath(), getDirectionInfo(), initCoordinates()) in Path, and make notations in the related class due to Path become abstract(put override above the related method to indicate the implementation of abstract method) 2.delete the unneeded constructor in these classes.
######### 
# Step 9

Code affected: Direction.java

Flaw: The structure of this code is gross and we need a more neat way write this class

Fix: Using enumerated type and add a DirEnum.java
